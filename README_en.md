### Core Components

| Component | File | Responsibility |
|-----------|------|----------------|
| **Worker Entry** | `src/worker/index.ts` | HTTP routing, API handling, WebSocket upgrade |
| **SSHSessionDO** | `src/worker/durable-object.ts` | SSH session lifecycle management, SSRF protection |
| **UserDBDO** | `src/worker/user-db.ts` | User data, server configs, rate limiting (SQLite) |
| **SSHSession** | `src/worker/ssh-session.ts` | SSH protocol state machine (connect→version→kex→auth→interactive) |
| **SSH Protocol Stack** | `src/ssh/*.ts` | Pure TypeScript SSH-2.0 implementation (transport, crypto, auth, channels) |
| **Frontend Terminal** | `frontend/src/terminal.ts` | xterm.js wrapper, trzsz integration, WebSocket management |

### SSH Protocol Implementation

This project implements a complete SSH-2.0 protocol stack:

| Layer | Implementation | Supported Algorithms |
|-------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Key Exchange** | `kex-curve25519.ts` / `kex-ecdh.ts` | curve25519-sha256, ecdh-sha2-nistp256 |
| **Data Encryption** | `crypto.ts` | aes256-gcm, aes128-gcm, aes256-ctr, aes192-ctr, aes128-ctr |
| **Integrity** | `crypto.ts` | hmac-sha2-256, hmac-sha2-512, hmac-sha1 |
| **Host Keys** | `ssh-session.ts` | Ed25519, ECDSA P-256, RSA |
| **User Auth** | `auth.ts` | Password authentication, Ed25519 public key authentication |
| **Channel Management** | `channel.ts` | Session channel, PTY, shell, window-change |

### Data Flow

1. The user enters the host IP, username, and password on the frontend (or selects a saved server via GitHub OAuth).
2. The frontend establishes a WebSocket connection with the backend Durable Object.
3. SSHSessionDO receives the credentials and establishes a TCP connection with the target SSH server using `@cloudflare/sockets`.
4. SSHSession executes the complete SSH protocol negotiation (version exchange → key exchange → authentication → channel open → PTY → Shell).
5. Encrypted terminal data is bidirectionally forwarded between the frontend and SSH server via WebSocket.

## Quick Deployment

### Prerequisites

- A Cloudflare account.
- Node.js environment (v18+).
- Cloudflare Workers Free Plan enabled (required for TCP Sockets and Durable Objects features).

### Steps

#### Method 1: Deploy via GitHub Integration (Recommended)

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account.
2. **Setup Deployment**: Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard, go to Workers & Pages to connect your GitHub account, and select the forked repository.
3. **Build Command**: During the deployment configuration, make sure to enter `pnpm run build:frontend` as the Build command, then deploy with one click (the build output directory can be left blank).
4. **Access the App**: After successful deployment, you can access it via the default domain `https://cloudssh.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`.
5. **Bind Custom Domain** (Optional): In the Cloudflare Dashboard Workers settings, go to "Triggers" → "Custom Domains" to add your domain.

#### Method 2: Local CLI Deployment

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/newbietan/CloudSSH.git
   cd CloudSSH
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install -g pnpm
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Login to Cloudflare**
   ```bash
   npx wrangler login
   ```

4. **One-Click Deploy**
   ```bash
   pnpm run deploy
   ```

Once deployed, Wrangler will output your Worker URL. Open that URL in your browser to start using your Web SSH terminal.

5. **Bind Custom Domain** (Optional): In the Cloudflare Dashboard Workers settings, go to "Triggers" → "Custom Domains" to add your domain.

#### Optional: Configure Turnstile Human Verification

To prevent malicious bot abuse, it is recommended to enable Cloudflare Turnstile verification:

1. **Create Turnstile Widget**: Log in to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), go to the Turnstile page and create a new Widget.
2. **Get Keys**: After creation, you will receive a **Site Key** (public) and a **Secret Key** (private).
3. **Configure Environment Variables**: In the Cloudflare Dashboard Workers settings, go to "Settings" → "Variables and Secrets", add the following environment variables:
   - `TURNSTILE_SECRET` = your Secret Key (Type: Secret)
   - `TURNSTILE_SITEKEY` = your Site Key (Type: Text)
4. **Redeploy**: Run the deployment command to apply the configuration.

> **Note**: Turnstile verification is session-level. After verification, all features are available for the current session. Closing the browser will require re-verification.

#### Optional: Configure GitHub OAuth Login & Server Management

With GitHub OAuth enabled, users can log in with their GitHub account and save/manage their frequently used SSH servers in a personal dashboard for one-click connections. When not configured, this feature is automatically hidden and does not affect the anonymous SSH connection functionality.

1. **Create a GitHub OAuth App**:
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → OAuth Apps → [New OAuth App](https://github.com/settings/applications/new)
   - **Application name**: `CloudSSH` (customizable)
   - **Homepage URL**: `https://your-domain.com` (your deployed domain)
   - **Authorization callback URL**: `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback`
   - After creation, note the **Client ID**, then click **Generate a new client secret** to get the **Client Secret** (shown only once, save it immediately)

2. **Configure Environment Variables**: In the Cloudflare Dashboard Workers settings, go to "Settings" → "Variables and Secrets", add the following environment variables:
   - `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` = your Client ID (Type: Text)
   - `BASE_URL` = `https://your-domain.com` (your deployed domain, Type: Text)
   - `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` = your Client Secret (Type: Secret)

3. **Redeploy**: If you just added the variables and are enabling the feature for the first time, you must delete the old deployment and redeploy to initialize the database.

> **Note**: Server credentials (passwords/private keys) are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before storage. The local encryption key is automatically generated and safely stored in the database (you can also manually override it by setting `SESSION_SECRET` in environment variables). During connection, credentials never pass through the frontend — they are securely transmitted via a one-time-token mechanism.

> **Important**: Enabling this feature for the first time requires a clean deployment (delete the old Worker first, then redeploy) to initialize the new Durable Object. Use `npx wrangler delete cloudssh` to remove the old Worker, then run `pnpm run deploy` to redeploy.
